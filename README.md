### Hi Folks!👋 
I am Bhanvi, a final year(2022) Information Technology student from Jaipur Engineering College and Research Centre. Currently I am working as an AI/ML Intern at TCS after an enriching experience as a Jr. MLE at Omdena(global startup). I have contributed to Open Source through various programs (Facebook Developer Circle OpenSource Immersion Program 2020, Girl Script Summer of Code extended, Student Code-in, Hakin Codes). I landed as the National Winner of Big Data Hackathon by American Express and top 20 finalist of TCS Inframind-4.
